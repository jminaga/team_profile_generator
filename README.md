## team_profile_generator

# This homework was designed to create a team profile generator using a command line node app
# When a user initiates the node app they are given prompts to create a team consisting of a manager, engineer, and/or an intern
# The command line app generates an HTML file that shows the team members
# The email addresses will open up the default email provider
# The link will direct to the engineer's Github page

## Testing

# An additional feature on this homework was to use TDD by using the node package Jest.
# The video associated with this video will show each test passing
